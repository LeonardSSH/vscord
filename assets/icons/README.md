-   If possible, please use PNG file format
-   It should have a background that is not transparent and white, should use the main color from the language website UNLESS it's really nessecary to use something else (can't find color, no logo)
-   You should use the official logo of the language UNLESS it's nessecary to use other icon (not minimal, can't find transparent version)
-   The icon should be minimalist.

## Note

If you can't make an icon, then that's fine! Just add the language name to the list in next section! future contributor might be able to work on it!

## Missing Icon List

Use the following format `(Language Name) ((Language Icon.png)) ([Link to langauge website / information about the language])` where `()` is required, `[]` is optional
